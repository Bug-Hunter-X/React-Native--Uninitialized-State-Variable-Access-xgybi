# React Native Uninitialized State Variable Access

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized. This often happens when a component renders conditionally, and the state variable is not yet set when the component initially mounts. The problem typically manifests when dealing with asynchronous operations or when state updates aren't immediately reflected in the UI.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  Attempting to access the `myVariable` state variable before it's assigned a value within `componentDidMount` results in an undefined value or error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates the solution.  By providing a default value for `myVariable` (or using conditional rendering to check for its existence), we prevent errors.  Additionally, using the optional chaining operator (?.) helps with handling potentially null values gracefully. Asynchronous updates are handled using appropriate loading states or conditional rendering.
